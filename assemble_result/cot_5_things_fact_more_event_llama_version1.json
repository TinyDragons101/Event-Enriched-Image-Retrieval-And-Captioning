  "772168bb63b266d4": "Here is the caption:\n\nA groundbreaking archaeological discovery in Mongolia has unearthed the world's oldest known evidence of horse veterinary dental care, dating back to the Deer Stone-Khirigsuur culture between 1300-700 B.C. The image shows the skull of a ritually-sacrificed horse from Bayankhongor, central Mongolia, which is part of a study by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. The study, led by William Taylor, analyzed horse skulls from ancient burial areas on the Mongolian steppe, revealing that nomadic herders were experimenting with equine dentistry by sawing down their horses' teeth with stone tools if they were growing out of place and pulling out baby teeth if they were causing foals pain or difficulty while feeding. This practice, which dates back over 3,000 years, is significant because it counteracts previous theories that veterinary care was a \"western science\" developed by civilizations in China or the Mediterranean. The findings are also significant because they show that veterinary care is directly linked to the origins of horseback riding and herding in the region, and the innovation in veterinary care facilitated developments in horse control technologies, which in turn contributed to the spread of people, ideas, and organisms between East and West, driving globalization.",
